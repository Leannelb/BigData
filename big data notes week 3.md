# 3.0: Week 3 Introduction

    Data is the most important raw material for any analytical system.  Previous weeks have looked at identifying and qualifying data using identifiers and metadata. The quality, value, accuracy, and effectiveness of the output are heavily dependent on the adequacy of the input data. According to George Fueschsel, and early IBM programmer and instructor, "garbage in garbage out".  Appropriate measure and standards must be implemented for data collection, identifying sample space etc. Once collected the data must be evaluated and must ensure it complies with the minimum standard so that it can be classified as a reliable input source. This week will be concentrating on the challenges associated with data collection and standardisation, data reduction, ensuring immutability and adequacy of the data objects.  

As you work through this weekâ€™s content, consider the following:

- What is a data object in Big Data Collection?
- Why data objects are important
- What is the role of standardisation and why it is important?
- What are the disadvantages of complex standards?
- What are the implications of data changes in data analytics?
- How to ensure the immortality of data in Big Data Resources?- 
- When does the data become too much data?
- How to apply data reduction?
- How to ensure the adequacy of the data?
- What are the characteristics of a good big data resource?

# 3.1.0: Lesson 1 - Big Data Integration

The importance and role of adequate data objects in Big Data Analysis are unquestionable. Even though the exponential growth of digital technology has helped us create and store huge volume of data, identifying the appropriate data source and normalise the collection is still a massive challenge.  This video will be giving a general overview of the processes that are involved in collecting and integrating data objects. The corresponding chapters in the core text will be providing more detailed information about the data collection and standardisation.

As you watch this lecture, reflect on the following:

 -   What are the different stages in Data Analysis?
 -   What is the importance of Data collection?
 -   How do you identify the data sources?
 -   Why data quality is important?

### What are the different stages in Data Analysis?
 1. Data Collection
 - collecting data from different sources
 - v important need to have right data before we start
 2. Data Cleansing
 - detecting and removing innacurate data from the data set. 
 3. Data Transformation
 - converts clean data into consistent and an acceptable layout into acceptable data using standardisation and normalisaton.
 4. statistical analysis
 - data is ready for analysis
 - statistical analysis identifies trends, patterns etc.
 - statistical analysis, algorythm and visualisation.

 ###  -   What is the importance of Data collection?
 A. Garbage in garbage out.
 - if correct data isnt used in the beggining you'll never get the right results out.

### How do you identify the data sources?
- general big data collection 
1. step 1 
- buy data from data as services companies
- collect from sources
2. Store data
- in databases for further resourses
- usually involves purchasing resorses to access data from anywhere
3. Clean up the data
- remove noisy information thats not needed
- concatinate
- merge data
4. reorganise
- reorganise after clean up
- organise and restructure data after cleaning
- add structure, sort from unstructured and semi structured and assign structure.
- tools like hadoop and HDFS
5. verify data
- choose some data and make sure it works for its intended purposes


### Why data quality is important?
- without good data starting, data wont output good results
- heavily dependant on the data collected to start.
