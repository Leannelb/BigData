# 3.0: Week 3 Introduction

    Data is the most important raw material for any analytical system.  Previous weeks have looked at identifying and qualifying data using identifiers and metadata. The quality, value, accuracy, and effectiveness of the output are heavily dependent on the adequacy of the input data. According to George Fueschsel, and early IBM programmer and instructor, "garbage in garbage out".  Appropriate measure and standards must be implemented for data collection, identifying sample space etc. Once collected the data must be evaluated and must ensure it complies with the minimum standard so that it can be classified as a reliable input source. This week will be concentrating on the challenges associated with data collection and standardisation, data reduction, ensuring immutability and adequacy of the data objects.  

As you work through this weekâ€™s content, consider the following:

- What is a data object in Big Data Collection?
- Why data objects are important
- What is the role of standardisation and why it is important?
- What are the disadvantages of complex standards?
- What are the implications of data changes in data analytics?
- How to ensure the immortality of data in Big Data Resources?- 
- When does the data become too much data?
- How to apply data reduction?
- How to ensure the adequacy of the data?
- What are the characteristics of a good big data resource?
