# 4.0: Week 4 Introduction

    Welcome to week 4! This week will focus on big data techniques. The lectures and reading this week will analyse and review the challenges that can be faced in measuring and bringing large data sets together as well as reviewing some of the techniques that can be employed to mitigate these challenges. This week we will also look at speed scalability and large collections, including reviewing the techniques that can be employed to counter some of the obstacles in this area. Finally, we will finish the week looking at the relevance and importance of random numbers and their role in big data analytics.

 

As you work through this weekâ€™s content, consider the following questions:

   1.  What uses are there for counting and count functions in Big Data Analytics?
2. What techniques could you use to normalise data from multiple sources?
3. What techniques and criteria could you use to reduce data?
4. What other factors may affect demand for speed and scalability during analysis?
5. What other analysis techniques could you use or how could you combine techniques to make things easier/faster at scale
6. Why is it important to use pseudo-random number generators to assist with analysis?
7.  How can random numbers assist with generating through-time models and trend analysis?

Big Data presents a number of challenges to analysis, especially when we are dealing with multiple sources or in fact multiple analysts.  This session looks to explore some of the challenges found when looking to measure data or bring datasets together.

As you watch this lecture, reflect on:

    What uses are there for counting and count functions in Big Data Analytics?
    What techniques could you use to normalise data from multiple sources?
    What techniques and criteria could you use to reduce data?

 

# 4.2.0: Lesson 2 - Speed, Scalability and Large Collections

icon Lesson 2 - Speed, Scalability and Large Collections

With the world demanding bigger and faster access to information, how do we approach these requirements and what obstacles might we face?  This session explores the impact various factors on data scalability and processing speed in large collections.

While you watch this lecture, reflect on the below questions.

    What other factors may effect demand for speed and scalability during analysis?
    What other analysis techniques could you use or how could you combine techniques to make things easier/faster at scale?
