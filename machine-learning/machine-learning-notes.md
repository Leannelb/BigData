# Machine Learning Notes

## Lecture 1: (1.1)


Machine learning
  ~ Teaching machine what comes naturally to humans/animals
  ~ Posteriori knowledge driven, learning from experiences


### Solve Real World Problems

1. Energy Production
2. Computer Vision and image processing
3. Computational Biology
    - DNA sequencing

### How it works

#### Supervised Learning
    
    1. A model is trained to accept an input and and output

#### Unsupervised Learning 
    1.  Find intrinsic or hidden features of the data (i.e. inputs) that have no labelled output (or response)

# Matlab
![Arrays](arrays.png "Arrays")

### Matlab array indexing
- starts at 1 (not zero)
- matrix indexing is x(row,col)
    - so x(: , 3)
    - refers to all values in the third row of the matrix

### vectors indexing
- vectors only have 1 index
- because there 1D
- they're not a matrix, just an array

### Supervised learning techniques
