# 1.0.0: Week 1 Introduction

Weekly Introduction

    Welcome to Week 1! During this week we will cover a brief, clear and concise overview of the field of data sciences and the evolution of big data from a technical point of view. You will see how to harness the power of a large amount of data, big data and data science for new insights and information using appropriate data analysis tools and technologies. You will see why you want to use data visualization and why you might prefer to use Python and associated tools for developing your data science project or business. Then we're going to go over some simple examples of how to actually use these tools.

## DUE: Early in the week

### Read 
the following early in the week to help you respond to the discussion questions and to complete your assignment(s).

#### Required Readings:
- Ceder, N (2018) The Quick Python Book. Third Edition, Manning Publications Co, Shelter Island, Chapter One and Chapter two. (WO 3)
- The Data Science Venn Diagram (Links to an external site.) (Read later in the week) (WO 2,3)
#### Suggested readings:
- (2015) Data Science and Big Data Analytics: Discovering, Analyzing, Visualizing and Presenting Data. Wiley, Chapter one. (WO 1,2)


## 1.1: What is Data Science?
    Data Science is not about Data, Math or Statistics and surely is not about fundamentals Sciences practised in the research laboratories. This presentation provides an introduction to data science concepts and their importance. Since this module is rather hands-on and technical, you should know precisely what it is about and what it is not about. This will help you to focus your efforts in the right direction as you are required to use various tools and technologies in data science and apply them to your data effectively. We are also looking into some popular tools used in data science.

    
Read through the presentation as I explain the following topic: Toward a better and more technical understanding of Data Science, its importance and required tools

 

As you view the presentation, reflect on the following:

What is data science about and what isn’t it about?
What is the science in data science about?
Is data science a new science or new data type or just a new jargon?
Why is so important?
Why do we want to visualize data and what is its significance?

While you watch this lecture, reflect on the below questions.

    Are there any additional reason, not listed in the video, for big data systems failure?
    What might be the extended impact on an organisation of a big data system failure?
    Are there any circumstances where failure of big data may have an effect on a wide population?


## BOOK NOTES
### The Quick Python Book chapter 1
#### Types are associated with objects, not variables. 
- A variable can be assigned a value of any type, and a list can contain objects of many different types. This also means that type casting usually isn’t necessary, and your code isn’t locked into the straitjacket of predeclared types.
####  Python typically operates at a much higher level of abstraction. 
- This is partly the result of the way the language is built and partly the result of an extensive standard code library that comes with the Python distribution. A program to download a web page can be written in two or three lines!
#### Syntax rules are very simple. 
- Although becoming an expert Pythonista takes time and effort, even beginners can absorb enough Python syntax to write useful code quickly.
