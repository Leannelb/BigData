## Sample Data
### Weather 
| Data | Features | Source | Complexity |
|:----:|:--------:|:------:|:-----------:| 
Weather | Structured, semi structured, data | Governmental Agencies, Public news channels, Social media | MetaData, Geo Coding, Languge, Image and Video formats |

### Processing unstructured data
1. Processing free text
2. Translate into prefered language
3. Parse into scentences (fundamental unit of a natural language)
4. Extract & Normalise/Minimise
5. Mapping terms to standard nomenclature & annotate or tag
6. Now data has some description and values. Now we classify it 
7. Classified data assigned to a data retrival system (store data)
8. Index the data

        The core text and lectures have highlighted three main V’s in relation to Big Data, namely Volume Variety and Velocity (Berman, 2018). These refer to the large amount of data (volume), with the velocity describing the speed at which the data is processed, with the Variety of the data referring to the types of data the overall data is comprised of. This can be vast and expansive. For example, location information, social media information, images, sound recordings etc. Other factors play a role too, for example the value of the data is a consideration with this referring to the important parts of this vast and varied data collected. The veracity therefore plays a part too and if the data holds value, how well can this data be trusted? How reliable is it to base decisions on? These last two V’s are described by Basim Alwan and Ku-Mahamud in their 2020 paper. Other sources have shown many other V’s, with the total amount varying. Some going as far as proposing 51 V’s! (Khan et al., 2019). The real takeaway for me however was, data is ever growing and expanding in todays world. The need for and the desire to analyse it will continue as the data grows and this must be done in a wise and efficient manner for the best results and to enable actual and positive use of this data.
